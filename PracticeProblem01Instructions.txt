Create a class called LoopsAndConditionsPractice01

In your main method ask the user to input integer values within the
range of 1 - 100 until the number '-365' is entered. Then display 
how many entries were even even, greater than or less than 50,
were within the required range, and the total number of entries
(not including the sentinel entry). 

Expected output: 

Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 65
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 22
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 96
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 8123
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 48
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): 73
Please enter an integer 1 - 100 (-365 to stop): -365

Even: 3
50 or greater: 3
Valid entries: 5
Total entries: 6
